install packages:
```ruby
install.packages("BiocManager")
library(BiocManager)
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
install.packages("DESeq2")
library("DESeq2") 
```
load data and have a look how it looks like:
```ruby
read.counts=read.table("C:\\Users\\Sophia Schmidt\\Documents\\Uni\\Master\\Programming for Life Science\\raw_countstdl.txt")
head(read.counts, n=5)
names(read.counts)
```

Question to everyone: It does not recognize DESeqDataSetFromMatrix. But it is a known object. See [https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/DESeq2/versions/1.12.3/topics/DESeqDataSet-class]
```ruby
DESeq . ds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix ( countData = readcounts ,
                                       25 colData = sample _info ,
                                       26 design = ~ condition )
DESeqDataSetFromMatrix
sumOfRow = rowSums(read.counts)
read.counts=cbind(read.counts,sumOfRow)
read.counts.keep=subset(read.counts, read.counts$sumOfRow >0)
head(read.counts.keep, n=5)
```
